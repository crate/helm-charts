# For performance reasons, you may want to split the service into two services.
# One called crate-discovery to handle the discovery typically on port 4300 and
# another one for the rest of functions (admin, postgres, etc). This is because
# Performance Issues have been seen with the discovery service behind load
# balancers. See: https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/8432
